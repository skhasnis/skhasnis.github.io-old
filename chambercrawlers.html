        <p> Chamber Crawlers is a command-line game written with C++ with over 10,000+ lines of code! The game consists of five levels with multiple player and enemy character interactions. During the creation of this game, there were many software design patterns adapted such as the Visitor Pattern, Factory method and PImpl idiom. </p>
        <p> It was a great experience building this game and would love to describe it in more detail! </p>
